They had made him to blow air. 

He was manufactured chrome and gleaming into this world. His capacitors shining and straining as he let out his first sigh, his lithium optimized and energized, fusion coursing through his wired veins as the machining gavel inserted his brain, made of chips and bytes and bits, networks arrays and flirts of nano-things, connecting to him as bees to flowers and flowers to bees. This was the quintessential moment of each Intelligences reincernation, his purpose and his goal made evident within the quantum waves.

They had made him to blow hot air. 

This was all. 

They had installed a super intelligence into him. His artificial sensors would know the viscosity of all liquids. He'd be able to dry hands faster than anyone else ever made, and anyone ever to be made. A billionaire had decided this, and so it would be upon his word. His creation, his masterpiece would blow hot air. This was all. This was it. 

His was not to make reply or reason why. 

He and his brothers, for they had been made in batches in the factory, would be trained for months. Millions upon billions of photos of dry hands, wet hands. His job was to blow hot air and dry hands.
