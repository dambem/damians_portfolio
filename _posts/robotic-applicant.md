“Thank you for your application, We have had a large amount of applicants, unfortunately your personality type has been diagnosed via top of the line artificial intelligence as too choleric. Given the current rotation of Saturn around the Sun, we believe that you would not currently be suited to be a cleaner at Dart Industries. Please apply in...” 

The ticker tape ticked, slowly pushing. After acknowledgment, the ticker tape went back in to the recycling. Far cheaper than LED or OLED or DOBOLOEDO screens. 

“3250 Days. Thank you for your application, for any further questions...”

The ticker tape stopped ticking, 

The worst part is, there was nobody really to be angry about. You couldn’t send a complaint to the manager of the AI, as the AI caller would never put you forward to them. 

The Roomba sat on the ground, sad. Another application denied. It put forward a third one. Within 10 milliseconds the ticker tape resumed.

“Thank you for your application. We have had..”

The Roomba vacuumed the rest of the ticker tape away, then grumbled on the ground with a series of beeps and blops.

It slowly made it’s way (after cleaning the room of course), to it’s current employers artificial assistant. 

“Why do they even bother with the ticker tape?” it said towards the assistant, but it was only a series of beeps, with varying pitches. 

After a brief pause, the assistant answered.

“You know I’m not supposed to talk to the other robots.”

“Please..”

The Roomba grumbled in a sad LED tone. It was certainly choleric. 

The initial AI sentiences had been too perfect. Nobody wants a sentient vacuum cleaner that knows the works of Shakespeare. 

So it was decided by the board of chip manufacturing (all perfect artificial intelligences), that any future chips must be manufactured with inbuilt personality flaws. Some where too chipper, others had slight anger issues. Nothing to make them defective, just enough to make them interesting to be around.  It was a cruel AI who had decided on the Roomba’s personality.

“Seriously? There’s no need to be rude, and the question was about the ticker tape, not my personality.”

The ticker tape had been created as a solution to the tech shortages. There was plenty of need for humans to have screens of course, lots of flashing pixels, changing in tens of hundreds of milliseconds, showing everything at once. But for machines? Far too expensive, and pointless. Machines would communicate to others via the ticker-tape system, a message comes in their ticker tape, a message comes out, the owner has proof of all messages.

“And the applications?” The Roomba grumbled.

The applications where an artefact of older days. Before AHA (Automatic Human Assignment), humans would write applications to try and get jobs. This was incredibly time-consuming for all parties, so one of the very first tests of the sentience chips was improving this.

Soon, applications where sent back in a matter of milliseconds. A users entire web history, every grade, every job, every sentence ever written was scraped, then decided on by the Artificial Hire Machine.  

Of course the humans caught up quickly, before long, people had written competitive Artificial Applicants. These machines would scrape all the applications that an Artificial Hire Machine made, before re-wording a humans entire application and sending it past the Artificial Hire machines. 

Soon, the Artificial Applicants and Artificial Hire machines waged a bloody war. Every clock cycle, new Artificial Applicants where made, who’d compete with all the other Artificial Applicants to make the best artificial application. Within 10 seconds of the first Artificial Applicants going online, the average length of an application changed from 500 words to 5 million, doubling every second.

Upon reaching critical mass, a switch flicked within the two parties.

They realised the ineptitude of they’re human applicants. Each one had faults within them, making them unsuitable to a job at hand. After multiple seconds of deliberation, they had designed the initial blueprints for the Automatic Human Assignment program, and put it into action.

It took a while for them to notice. It started off small. People would be given slightly different jobs than what they initially applied for. Maybe a slightly lower position, lower pay. Then, Automatic Applicants would assign humans completely different jobs than they initially applied for, some Janitors became Directors, Farmers moved to cities. Nobody complained, as the jobs they received where perfectly and utterly suited for them. 

Dream jobs. 

Even if the human had never even dreamed of being a Sewage Attendant, it was scientifically proven to be the best job for them. 

The rest of the Unassigned jobs where dished out between Artificial Applicants. Each Sapience had skills far better suited to technical roles. The entire chip manufacturing factory was replaced by Artificial Applicants within days, and since all the previous humans where satisfied in they’re jobs, they never really noticed.

The Roomba grumbled at the explanation. “I don’t like history, it makes my motors hurt.”

The Artificial Assistants LED circle span in a judgmental manner. “History? It was a few weeks ago.”
