```
upon a raft in the Aegean,

he sees naught but sea and sky,

no quick wit can now avert him,

from the strings of fate divine


Odysseus the humble

Father,

Husband,

Murderer.


Cunning fox?

Deceitful serpent?

His honour lost under the waves,

Where thousand men unburied lay.


A stolen thief,

Beneath the stars, 

He draws waves,

A pencil for an oar.



Was he favourite of the gods?

Did he blind Polyphemus?

Or did his eyes instead,

See monsters where men lay.



A rising wave lifts some,

Itâ€™s crest sinks others,

A man disappears,

His myth rises. 



Sapphire tears flow onto the sea,

An echo of thunder stalks behind,

And ahead, in the mirage ~

An island of emeralds.
